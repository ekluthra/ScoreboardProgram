# ScoreboardProgram

This program simply displays a scoreboard, and allows the user to change the scores and fouls of each team
The team with the greatest score will have their score be displayed on the seven segment display
If one team reaches 10 points, they win. If one team reaches 10 fouls, the other team wins

This program will not run unless the computer has a parallel port, since it uses the parallelput command.
